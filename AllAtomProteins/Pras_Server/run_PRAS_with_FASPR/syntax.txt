Compile FASPR
`g++ -ffast-math -O3 -o FASPR src/*.cpp`

Install PRAS server
`pip install Pras-Server==1.2.1`

Execute to run PRAS with FASPR output PDB
`./FASPR â€“i 1aho.pdb -o output.pdb;python3 linux_example.py 1aho.pdb "" "" output.pdb "" "" "" ""`

You will see that both 	secondary structure assignemnt(ss) and ramachandran plot (rama) 
are set to False and the reason is because you must install X server for Windows
in order to run Linux GUI applications using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Thus, you need to:

Install X server for Windows

Configure bash to tell GUIs to use the local X server

So, install VcXsrv which is open source by downloading from https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/

Configure bash to use the local X server (VcXsrv is an X server). In bash run:

`echo "export DISPLAY=localhost:0.0" >> ~/.bashrc`

To have the configuration changes take effect, restart bash, or run:

`. ~/.bashrc`

Then open VcXsrv from your taskbar (you should send the icon to taskbar for easy access).
Note that VcXsrv must be open/running each time you use plotting tools in the linux terminal
Now you can set ss True and raman True
