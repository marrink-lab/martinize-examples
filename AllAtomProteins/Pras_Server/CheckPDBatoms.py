    The default behaviour of PRAS is to generate
    clean protein structures. This is because ligands
    are specially treated in docking or MD simulation.

    the ligands (non-water ligands), this function will
    extract the ligand coordinates to be appended to
    the particular chain it belongs to in the PDB
    structure file

                     chain then the ligand in that particular

    See PRAS.py for the detailed explanation of the arguments passed.

    Arguments
    ----------
    pdb_pras:    the PDB file you intend to repair/analyze

    rotamer:     supply "no" if you need to generate lower occupancy conformers,
                 if not supply "". PRAS uses atoms with highest occupancy by default.

    mutation:    supply "no" if you need to generate lower occupancy conformers,
                 if not supply "". PRAS uses the residue with highest occupancy by default
                 if two residues are given same residue number

    pdb_faspr:   the output PDB obtained by running your PDB with FASPR

    keep_ligand: by default, ligands and entries with HETATM are ignored because in most
                 MD simulation and docking studies the ligand is specially treated. Moreover,
                 PRAS does not repair ligands (ligand structure is diverse compared with protein
                 with 20 repeating common amino acids!). However, user can supply any string as
                 the argument if user intends to keep ligands.

    chain_no   : by default, all the chains in the PDB will be processed. However, if user intends to
                 use a specific chain, user should provide an integer or a string number as the argument.
                 PRAS will map the integer to alphabets. Chain can start with any letter. Thus,
                 1 = the first chain, 2 = the second chain, etc. If user supplies a string number PRAS
                 will convert it to integer but if alphabet error will be generated.
